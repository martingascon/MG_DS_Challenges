# Supermarket. Martin Gascon. Insight Data Science. 
# ============================================================
# There is a large dataset containing geographical information about points of sale for products, for thousands of customers 
# and thousands of products. The original dataset was in the form of 3 tables:
# a)  supermarket_distances: three columns. The first column is the customer id, the second is the shop id and the third 
#     is the distance between the customerâ€™s house and the shop location. The distance is a calculated in meters as a straight 
#     line so it does not take into account the road graph.
# b) supermarket_prices: two columns. The first column is the product id and the second column is its unit price. 
#    The price is in Euro and it is calculated as the average unit price for the time span of the dataset.
# c) supermarket_purchases: four columns. The first column is the customer id, the second is the product id, the third 
#    is the shop id and the fourth is the total amount of items that the customer bought the product in that particular shop. 
#    The data is recorded from January 2007 to December 2011.

# For ease of analysis, we will be working with an aggregated version of the dataset.  
# The data is aggregated by customer, and info from different shops are pivoted to new columns. 
# We've added this file (csv format) to the "Data Challenges/Supermarket" Dropbox folder.

# Imagine you were a data scientist working for a large supermarket chain and were given this dataset. 
# Obviously you will need to initially explore and visualize the data, but ultimately try to find *actionable*
# insights rather than "interesting" findings.
